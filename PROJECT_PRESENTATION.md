Pokedex!

Hello Trainer!

We need your help, we are just about to go into a Pokémon Battle, please help me organize my deck before the fight.

Your task is to write a function named myOrganizedDeck.
That takes in an array of Pokémon objects and applies a booster to each Pokémon's baseStat by adding 50 points to each individual Pokemon in my deck.
Afterwards, the array should be sorted by their new base stats!

Input:
The input will be an array of Pokémon objects, where each object contains:

```http
🃏 name: a string representing the name of the Pokémon (i.e. "Pikachu").

🃏 baseStat: an integer representing the Pokémon's base stats (i.e. 320).

i.e. Pokedex = [{ name: "Pikachu", baseStat: 320 }],
```

Output:

The output should be the original array containing all of the Pokemon objects given, but with each Pokémon's baseStat boosted by 50 points.
The array should then be sorted from new highest base stat to new lowest base stat.

To start:

```http
 npm run test
```
