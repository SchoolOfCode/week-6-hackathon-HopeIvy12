// Pokedex!

//  Hello Trainer!

// We need your help, we are just about to go into a Pok√©mon Battle, please help me organize my deck before the fight.

// Your task is to write a function named myOrganizedDeck.
// That takes in an array of Pok√©mon objects and applies a booster to each Pok√©mon's baseStat by adding 50 points to each individual Pokemon in my deck.
// Afterwards, the array should be sorted by their new base stats!

// Input:
// The input will be an array of Pok√©mon objects, where each object contains:

// üÉè name: a string representing the name of the Pok√©mon (i.e. "Pikachu").

// üÉè baseStat: an integer representing the Pok√©mon's base stats (i.e. 320).

// i.e. Pokedex = [{ name: "Pikachu", baseStat: 320 }],

// Output:

// The output should the original array containing all of the Pokemon objects given, but with each Pok√©mon's baseStat boosted by 50 points.
// The array should then be sorted from new highest base stat to new lowest base stat.

export function myOrganizedDeck(Pokedex) {
  // Good luck!

}
